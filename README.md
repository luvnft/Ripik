# Problem Statement

In the insurance industry, processing claims for vehicle damage is a common and most essential task. With the advancement in AI and Computer Vision, the users can settle the claims online instantly by uploading the images of the damaged car with the insurance company.

Now, insurance companies face the constant challenge of identifying fraudulent claims. It's a common practice for the users to submit the fraudulent images as a part of the claim settlement process. This brings out the threat/challenge to the insurance companies to identify the fraudulent claims which leads to significant financial losses.

Fraudulent claims often involve exaggerating the extent of damage or submitting false claims altogether. In this problem, we will focus on the first type of problem i.e. exaggerating the extent of damage. To mitigate these losses and maintain the integrity of their operations, insurance companies must develop effective methods to flag out these claims most accurately and efficiently. 

The hackathon challenges you to develop a robust and high performance model for classifying an image of a car into different types of damages automatically with the help of computer vision techniques. By accurately identifying the damages, the insurance company can assess the legitimacy of the claim and make informed decisions regarding payouts.
